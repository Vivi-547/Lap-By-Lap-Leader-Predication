# Lap-By-Lap-Leader-Predication
This notebook leverages machine learning with RandomForestRegressor to predict lap-by-lap race leaders based on lap times and driver positions. It pulls race data from the Ergast API and generates insights into how race dynamics evolve. The project offers detailed predictions for understanding potential race outcomes.
